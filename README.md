# Resizing-the-frame-open-CV

Sometimes in the real time fetching of the data, it is required to resize the frame size as per our needs.
In some situations we shorten the frame and in others we increase its dimensions. The camera automatically resizes the frame with respect to the standard aspect ratio.

Here is a snap of the screenshot taken while coding, we converted the frame size from 480,640 to 288,352.
